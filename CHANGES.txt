* 1.1.0 (In Development)
    * NOTE: This point release contains significant and possibly breaking
      changes. The main feature is the addition of support for the Dynamixel
      AX-S1 sensor module. To enable this support some significant changes were
      needed, see below:
    * Adds AX-S1 support
    * A new DEVICES name replaces AX12 in defs and also contains AXS1
    * Methods for finding register lengths for a given module exist in their
      classes as opposed to on the network class.
    * Register lengths must now be passed into network requests.
    * PEP8 Cleanup
* 1.0.3
    * Fixes a bug in example.py on linux
* 1.0.2
    * Updates example script to be more user friendly
* 1.0.1
    * Initial release of pydynamixel to PyPI.
